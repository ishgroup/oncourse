/*
  This file specifies which javascript files will be
  included in your website. You can add additional javascript
  to the bottom of this file or in additional files like
  extra.js.

  The 'base' javascript package includes all the js required
  to allow onCourse to work. Do not remove it.

  Every time you edit this file or any of the included javascript,
  a file called all.js will be automatically regenerated. If you
  set 'minify on' in the first line of this file, the output will
  be minified. Be careful since with poorly formed js, this can break
  your site. Even if you don't minify, the output will always be
  compressed.
