The position will not necessarily lead to further or on-going employment
opportunities. The pay rate includes face-to-face teaching, preparation,
sick pay and holiday pay. The position requires you to plan, conduct and
evaluate the course in a professional manner. You are required to ensure
that training venues are left in a clean and tidy condition and that
students and other Tutors work is respected. Please use the recycling
facilities provided in the classroom and encourage students to use them as
well.

You are required to keep students personal details in a secure place and
under no circumstances can information concerning students be relayed to a
third party without the express written consent of the Director.

You are required to collect class attendance sheet and venue key, and
organise photocopying prior to commencement of each class (check with
office to ensure time suitability). Audio-visual equipment should be
checked for availability.

If tutors wish to place any form of extra advertising or media release
which is of their own accord, then it should have in some way either the
BCC name or logo attached to it and needs to be approved by the College.

If you are unable to attend the class due to unavoidable circumstances, you
are required to make alternate arrangements with your students and then
advise the office.

If it is necessary for you to terminate your employment before the end of
your agreed period, a minimum of two weeks notice of your intention must
be given to the Director. Should management deem that you are not
conducting, or have not conducted your course in an appropriate manner, BCC
reserves the right to terminate your employment without notice. Grievance
procedures would then be available.

FINAL WAGES WILL BE PAID ON COURSE COMPLETION AND UPON RETURN OF INVOICE,
VENUE KEYS, COMPLETED CLASS ROLE, STUDENT AND TUTOR EVALUATION FORMS.

Regards,

Vicki Walker
