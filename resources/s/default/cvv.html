	<h2>What is CVV?</h2>
	<p>The Card Verification Value, or CVV, is an extra code printed on your debit or credit card.</p>
	
	<div class="container">
		<p><img src="/s/img/visa-cvv.png" width="197" height="126" alt="Visa and MasterCard CVV location" class="imgleft"> For <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>MasterCard</strong> it is the final three digits of the number printed on the signature strip on the reverse of your card.</p>
	</div>

    	<p><img src="/s/img/amex-cvv.png" width="197" height="126" alt="American Express CVV location" class="imgleft"> On <strong>American Express</strong> the CVV appears as a separate 4-digit code printed on the front of your card.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>As the CVV is not embossed (like the card number), the CVV is not printed on any receipts, hence it is not likely to be known by anyone other than the actual card owner.</p>
	<p>CVV is an anti-fraud measure being introduced by credit card companies worldwide. It is required that you enter the CVV printed on your card each time a payment is made and you are not present to sign a receipt, as for on-line transactions.</p>
	<p>We ask you to fill out the CVV here to verify that you actually hold the card you are using for this transaction, and to avoid anyone other than you from shopping with your card number.</p>
    <p>All information you submit is transferred over secure SSL connections.</p>
	
	<p><strong class="alert">Note:</strong> The name of this code differs per card company. You may also know it as the Card Verification Code (CVC), the Card Security Code or the Personal Security Code. All names cover the same type of information.</p>
