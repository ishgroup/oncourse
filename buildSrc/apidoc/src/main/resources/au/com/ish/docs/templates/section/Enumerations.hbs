These are Java classes which represent a list of options, where that list is hardcoded into the application and
cannot be extended by the user.
In normal use you would not care about the database value and instead use the enumeration by name.
For example:

```
if (myAccount.type == AccountType.ASSET) {
  # do something
}
```
{{#splitClasses classes}}
{{#each (sort enums "name")}}
{{{renderChapter this}}}
{{/each}}
{{/splitClasses}}
