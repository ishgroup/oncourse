These are objects which represent the data stored in onCourse.
You will typically search for them using the onCourse query language.
These objects will be in the Cayenne Context named 'context' by default, so you can make changes and store them back
into onCourse using context.commitChanges(). The database tables often don't match the description of
the entities here since we use inheritance and different naming to better describe the data schema in code.
