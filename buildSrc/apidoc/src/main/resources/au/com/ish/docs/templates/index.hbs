# onCourse Domain Specific Language (DSL)

onCourse implements a DSL built on top of Apache Groovy.
This provides you a powerful language for creating scripts, exports and reports inside onCourse.

This document only describes the DSL extensions to Groovy. You have the entire language at your disposal,
and you should take the time to read the [excellent documentation available](http://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html).
Note that you cannot use closures inside JasperReport templates. For exports only, you can also make use of the
[SuperCSV project](http://super-csv.github.io/super-csv/) to simplify the generation of CSV export data.

// This funny hack is necessary since we aren't parsing the entire src tree, so we can't get the
// superclass of the superclass and check it is a CayenneDataObject
