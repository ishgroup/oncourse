I added comments in html
Now, I'm not sure where should be located bootstrap-checkbox.min, I think you'll place it correctly

About svg
svg-styles only for svg
when you'll place svg-files and css-file in folders, change in svg (if it present) <?xml-stylesheet href="svg-styles.css" type="text/css"?> (on the right href)
ang change data/src in object/img on the right path

Thank you!

So, I think after clicking "edit roll" page uplading and we have new static page.
for example we have "show class" and "edit(mark) class"

file task27482.html contains js effect  
he needs to show how it will look website dynamically with all styles
may be you will use this path, can be static pages, I do not know
