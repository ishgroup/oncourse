I added comments in html
Now, I'm not sure where should be located bootstrap-checkbox.min, I think you'll place it correctly

About svg
svg-styles only for svg
when you'll place svg-files and css-file in folders, change in svg (if it present) <?xml-stylesheet href="svg-styles.css" type="text/css"?> (on the right href)
ang change data/src in object/img on the right path

Thank you!
