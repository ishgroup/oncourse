/**
 * Email sending API. You can render email content from templates or a text string. If the recipient is a contact object
 * and there is no attachment, the message is stored inside the onCourse database. If the recipient is an email address
 * or there is an attachment, then the message is sent directly without storage.
 *
 * Simple usage example:
 * ```
 * email {
 *     template "Enrolment Confirmation"
 *     bindings enrolment: e
 *     to c
 * }
 * ```
 * The above example will render the template with the name "Enrolment Confirmation" and pass "enrolment" to that template
 * with the value of the Enrolment e in the script. It will send that email to the contact c.
 *
 * You can optionally also pass a from address if you don't want to use the default email.from preference. And you can override
 * the email address associated with a certain contact or send to a list of contacts.
 *
 * ```
 * email {
 *     template "Enrolment Confirmation"
 *     from "college@example.com"
 *     to c1, c2 >> "anotheremail@example.com"
 *     bindings enrolment: e
 * }
 * ```
 * The only lines which are required are "template", "bindings" and "to"
 *
 *
 * You can send emails to an email address (instead of a contact record) and attach a file, without storing this data inside onCourse.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 *  email {
 *      from "admin@example.com"
 *      to "recipient@example.com"
 *      cc "ccrecipient@example.com"
 *      bcc "bccrecipient@example.com"
 *      subject "test email"
 *      content "test email content"
 *      attachment "accounts.csv", "text/csv", account_csv_data
 *  }
 * ```
 * The only lines which are required are "to", "subject" and "content" or "to", "template" and "bindings"
 *
 *
 * Email collision functionality. Allows to skip sending emails automatically if contact have already received email with specified key.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * email {
 *     template "Enrolment Confirmation"
 *     bindings enrolment: e
 *     to c
 *     key "ABC", c
 *     keyCollision "drop"
 * }
 * ```
