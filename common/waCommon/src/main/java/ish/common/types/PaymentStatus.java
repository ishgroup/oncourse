	 * Suggested comment: 'Indicates an as yet unconfirmed payment or enrolment.'
	 * <p>
	 * Suggested logic: On server startup, any payments or enrolments left in this state (due to a crash of some kind) can be set to {@link #QUEUED} so as to
	 * ensure that willow can be contacted again, if we crashed before the response, to obtain the result, or to contact willow for the first time if it never
	 * got that far before a crash. This would seem to remove the need for a null status which is not one of the official statuses.
	 * <p>
	 * Otherwise perhaps it'd make sense to for new payments/enrolments to always be committed from the client with a status of new thus allowing the
	 * server-side post-persist to update the status to success according to the logic of whether willow returned success, or willow is not involved, or if the
	 * gateway is disabled. Something to think about. Used by angel and willow
