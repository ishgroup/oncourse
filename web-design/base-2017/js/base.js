  This is a core javascript file which will be built into your website.
  
  All the require statements below will import further javascript, even though
  they look like comments.

  The resulting javascript will be merged, minified and zipped automatically into
  all.js and all.js.gz for serving to users. Don't try to edit those files since
  they will automatically be overridden.

  Google Closure compiler is used for minification.

/*
  
  Another javascript bundle named dynamic.js will be served to all users before all.js is loaded.
  It contains:
  
  classnames 2.2.5
